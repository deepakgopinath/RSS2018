The manuscript introduces a model selection framework to define the
control balance between the robotic assistance and human input in
reaching tasks. Information theory and probabilistic approaches are
used to describe the mathematical framework of human-robot interactive
control. The results are demonstrated in simulation. It is shown that
performance is improved when intention disambiguation is used.


Major:

- It was hard for me to fully understand the paper. I think this will
be the case for many readers who are not familiar with the topic and
mathematical concepts used by the authors. Probably, it is better to
have a longer version of the paper to be submitted to a more
theoretical venue.
- I think it is better to define certain terms such as "belief over
goals" and "intention disambiguation/inference" in the introduction.
Probably, more specific robotics example will be helpful.
- As I understand Algorithm 1 explains how intentions are obtained,
however it does not explain how this intentions are embedded in the
robot assistive controller. I think it is good to include the assistive
control part to Algorithm 1 or to present an algorithmic description of
how Algorithm 1 combines with the robot control
- Simulation methods are not described with sufficient details. It is
hard to reproduce this. Could you add equations for human and robot
control behaviour (u_h and u_r)? Adding detailed equations and
parameters to Appendix and supplementary material will be helpful.
- I would like to see time domain plots for R^2 simulation (human/robot
position/forces and intention metrics)
- I am not sure if it is valid to do statistical analysis of simulated
data


Minor:
- Add equation references to Algorithm 1
- Figures 2, 3 and 4 too small font-size to read
- "KL" is not explained in the abstract
- check for typos: "autonomYS intent inference "
