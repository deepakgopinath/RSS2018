All reviewers agreed that topic is interesting and relevant to the
readership of IEEE RA-L. They also agreed that the work has some
novelty and appreciated its engineering complexity. However, all
reviewers think that the contribution of this work is questionable and
not clear at all. Both R3 and R9 claim that the paper is hard to
understand and suffers from lack of details to convince readers. R4
also has a number of questions and comments on experiment 2. I agree
with R9 that authors need to improve the overall structure of the paper
and related works, and more discussion is required in order to validate
their approach. R4 also has a similar concern that it is not clear
about its feasibility of 6DoF robot arm. I refer the authors to the
detailed reviews for more information.
